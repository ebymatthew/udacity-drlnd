Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Projects

### Project 1: Navigation

This [project](./p1_navigation) contains code for training a Deep Q-Network agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

### Project 2:  Continuous Control

This [project](./p2_continuous-control) contains code for training a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to control a reacher arm that is tracking a positional target.

### Project 3:  Tennis Multi-Agent Control

This [project](./p3_collab-compet) contains code for training Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agents to control to play tennis against each other.
